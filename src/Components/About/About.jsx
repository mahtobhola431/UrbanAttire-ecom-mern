        Founded in 2023 by UrbanGroup, UrbanAttire has come a long way from its beginnings in Mumbai. When [Your Name] first started out, his/her passion for eco-friendly and high-quality clothing drove him/her to quit his/her day job, and gave him/her the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into a booming online store. We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the fashion industry.
